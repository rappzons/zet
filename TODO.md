- Code
  - Refactor objectFactory to create enemy types instead of hardcoded enemies. Start with the virus-bal and the slime, should be one factory method.
  

- Movement
  - Slide under stuff, press down should shrink the hitbox and animate a sliding player
  - Shoot or sword? go with sword for now....
  - Hurt animation
      
- World
  - built from the physics editor instead of hand made. Can make "custom world shapes" not just flat ground...         
  - Enemies... first off just make something hurt him... then create an NPC that can actually hurt him... commited the blue-demon to use for this...
   
  
- Game
  - medieval dungeon cleaner? Eggs and stuff are dropped down in a hole
    and the dude needs to hack away until he can get saved. slime, slugs, shit, eggs (with spawning enemies) will fall down...
    have a creature-meter or something that you need to kep down.
    
    AND multi player: have two dungeons on the same screen and you can toss the enemies you get to your opponent.
    or co-op and help out clearing out the dungenon...
  - Game plot :)
    ideas:
    Use the physics!!! Not so much hack and slash or run and shoot, use physics in a "random" 
    way no gameplay should be exacly like the last... let say you go for a boss battle where there are physical objects laying all around and you have no weapon of your own
    - no learning the boss "patter" or using the correct weapon... just randomness and chaos
  - Player lives and health bar
  - Build overall game state: Menu, Paused, InGame, Level:1 ...etc..etc.
  
  ...
